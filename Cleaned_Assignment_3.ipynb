    "# Assignment 3: Mastering Conditional Statements and Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "> This assignment will reinforce your understanding of conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for, while).\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this assignment, you will create an interactive Python program that presents a menu of options to the user.\n",
    "> Each menu option will correspond to a specific task, such as performing calculations, processing lists or strings, or playing a guessing game.\n"

    "**Guidelines:**\n",
    "> - Discussing concepts with classmates is fine, but **all code and answers must be your own**.\n",
    "- **Do not copy** code or answers from classmates, online sources, or generative tools. Plagiarism will result in a zero for this assignment and could lead to further disciplinary action.\n",
    "- Using external help beyond what's acceptable is not allowed.\n",
    "- While using generative tools is encouraged for exploring ideas, relying on them too much at this stage will hinder your learning process. Focus on building your foundational skills.\n",
    "- For any doubts or clarification, feel free to reach out during office hours, post on the course forum, or ask for help during the recitation."

    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "- Your program should display a menu with 5 different options.\n",
    "- Based on the user's selection, the program should perform different tasks.\n",
    "- Use conditional statements to determine which menu option was selected and execute the appropriate code.\n",
    "- Some of the menu options will involve loops for repeated tasks, such as processing a list or repeating a game until the user completes it.\n",
    "- The program will keep running until the user chooses to exit (Option 5).\n",
    "- Include clear comments in your code to explain each part of the program."

    "### **Hints and Suggestions**:\n",
    "- Before starting each menu option, break down the problem and think about how conditionals and loops can be applied to solve it.\n",
    "- Test your program frequently. After adding each new feature (e.g., a menu option), run the code to ensure everything works as expected.\n",
    "- If you get stuck, review the examples and concepts from the recitation and the previous lectures.\n",
    "- For the \"Guess the Number Game,\" consider using Pythonâ€™s built-in `random` module to generate the random number.\n",
    "- Be mindful of **infinite loops**. Always ensure that your `while` loops have a clear exit condition, especially for the number guessing game.\n",
    "- Check out the following pages\n",

    "## **Menu Options**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program will present the following options to the user:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Option 1: Basic Calculator**  \n",
    "- Prompt the user to enter two numbers.\n",
    "- Ask the user to choose an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.\n",
    "- Based on the selected operation, perform the calculation and display the result.\n",
    "- Make sure to handle potential edge cases, such as division by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Option 2: Print List Elements**  \n",
    "- Ask the user to input a list of items (e.g., favorite movies, numbers, etc.).\n",
    "- Store these items in a Python list.\n",
    "- Use a loop to iterate through the list and print each item.\n",
    "- After printing all items, display how many items were in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Option 3: Guess the Number Game**  \n",
    "- The program should randomly generate a number between 1 and 100.\n",
    "- Use a loop to repeatedly ask the user to guess the number.\n",
    "- For each guess, provide feedback on whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.\n",
    "- Keep track of how many guesses the user made.\n",
    "- End the game once the correct number is guessed, and display the total number of attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Option 4: String Processing**  \n",
    "- Ask the user to input a string.\n",
    "- Provide the following sub-options for processing the string:\n",
    "  1. **Count Vowels**: Count and display the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.\n",
    "  2. **Reverse String**: Reverse the entire string and display it.\n",
    "  3. **String Length**: Display the length of the string.\n",
    "- The user should be able to select which string operation they would like to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Option 5: Exit the Program**  \n",
    "- If the user selects this option, the program should terminate gracefully.\n",
    "- Display a goodbye message and exit the loop that runs the menu.\n"

    "### **Additional Requirements**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input Validation**:  \n",
    "  Ensure that the program handles invalid inputs gracefully. For example, if the user selects an invalid menu option, display an error message and ask them to choose again.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Loop Control**:  \n",
    "  The program should continue displaying the menu after each operation, allowing the user to select another option until they choose to exit (Option 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use of Comments**:  \n",
    "  Be sure to include comments throughout your program, explaining what each section of code is doing. This is important for readability and demonstrating your understanding.\n"
